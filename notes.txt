Arrays in Memory
    1) each element in the array takes up the same number of slots
    2) all of the elements are right next to each other (contiguous)

    So, if each element takes up 2 slots, arr[3] would do 2 * 3 and go to the 6th slot
    If each element took up 1 slot, arr[3] would go to the third slot
    If each element takes up 51 slots, arr[3] would go to 3 * 51, so the 153rd slot

    so runtimes of:
        arr.pop() -- O(1)
        arr.pop(middleValue) -- O(n)
            -- bc all values must be contiguous, so values must cascade into different spots

    strings are arrays - each character is stored in a different slots

Character Encoding

    ASCII Tables = how we convert English letters and characters to binary, decimal, hexadecimal, html code, etc

    Unicode = same concept as ASCII but more complicated

    Each language has built-in methods to turn things into ASCII, Unicode, or something similar
        -- python = ord()
        -- JS = charCodeAt()
    
    Sometimes we need to convert between encoding systems or encode pdfs etc

    ASCII was the original character encoding systems
        -- ASCII is very limited though
        -- It works for English, but not for other languages/alphabets
        -- hence Unicode
